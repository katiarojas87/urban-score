## Test four Claude
Running with Claude using the following labels:
- luxury: 0.0 = cheap/basic (vinyl floors, stock cabinets, no detail),
1.0 = high-end (marble, bespoke millwork, designer fixtures, herringbone parquet, statement chandelier)
- condition:  0.0 = severe damage (peeling paint, water stains, cracked tiles, mold),
1.0 = pristine/immaculate (spotless, freshly renovated, zero blemishes)
- brightness: 0.0 = dark/dim (no windows, heavy curtains, dim bulb),
1.0 = sun-drenched (floor-to-ceiling glass, skylights, flooded with natural light, luminous)
- spaciousness: 0.0 = cramped/cluttered (low ceiling, blocked pathways),
1.0 = voluminous/grand (double-height, sweeping open-plan, expansive sightlines)

## Test four Claude
We work with rankings
